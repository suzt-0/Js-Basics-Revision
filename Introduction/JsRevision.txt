Overview
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic language for programming web pages, servers, and tools. 
It runs in browsers and on servers (Node.js), 
supports functional and object-oriented styles, 
and evolves quickly with modern standards (ECMAScript).

Foundations (2–4 weeks)
- Syntax & types: variables, primitives, objects, arrays
- Operators & control flow: if, switch, loops
- Functions: declarations, expressions, arrow functions, scope
- Hoisting & closures (basic)
- Basic DOM: selecting elements, events, simple manipulation
- Developer tools: console, debugger, basic troubleshooting

Modern JavaScript (2–4 weeks)
- ES6+ features: let/const, template literals, destructuring
- Modules: import/export
- Classes & prototypes: class syntax, prototype chain
- Promises, async/await, error handling
- Fetch API and AJAX basics

Intermediate (3–6 weeks)
- Advanced closures & scope patterns
- Event loop, microtasks vs macrotasks
- Advanced DOM: delegation, forms, accessibility basics
- Browser APIs: LocalStorage, SessionStorage, History, Canvas basics
- Bundling basics: modules, intro to webpack/rollup

Tooling & Testing (2–4 weeks)
- npm/yarn, package.json, scripts
- Linting & formatting: ESLint, Prettier
- Unit testing: Jest or Mocha + Chai
- Debugging advanced techniques
- Type checking intro: JSDoc and intro to TypeScript

Frameworks & Libraries (4–8 weeks)
- React fundamentals: components, props, state, hooks
- Vue or Angular basics (pick one for breadth)
- State management: Redux, MobX, Vuex or Pinia
- Routing, forms, and side-effect management
- Component testing & end-to-end testing (Cypress, Playwright)

Backend with Node.js (3–6 weeks)
- Node core: modules, fs, streams, events
- Express/Koa: building REST APIs
- Databases: MongoDB/Postgres basics, ORMs or query builders
- Authentication, authorization patterns
- Deployment basics: containers, cloud providers

Advanced Topics (ongoing)
- Performance optimization: profiling, critical rendering path
- Security: XSS, CSRF, CORS, secure headers
- Design patterns & architecture: functional programming, CQRS, hexagonal
- TypeScript mastery
- Scalability, microservices, serverless functions

Expert & Professional (ongoing)
- Contributing to open source
- Building libraries and CLI tools
- Advanced compiler/tooling internals (Babel, webpack)
- Mentoring, code reviews, system design
- Keeping up with ecosystem changes and proposals

Learning approach (short)
- Hands-on: build small projects for each phase.
- Read docs and spec sections for features you use.
- Practice debugging, write tests, and refactor regularly.
- Contribute to open-source or build a portfolio project that integrates frontend, backend, testing, and deployment.
